lagrangianExtraFunctionObjects
==============================

**lagrangianExtraFunctionObjects** is a function object library re-adapted from
OpenFOAM 5, to write to disk in the old `positions` file format.

**Note**: This branch `blueCFD-Core-2017` refers to the code adapted to build
with blueCFD-Core 2017. It also works with blueCFD-Core 2020.

* Please see the other branches for which OpenFOAM version you can use this on.

It has been created for the [issue 111 on blueCFD-Core](https://github.com/blueCFD/Core/issues/111),
given that ParaView does not support the new `positions` format provided by
OpenFOAM 5 and newer by the [OpenFOAM Foundation](http://openfoam.org).

This is in contrast to [ESI-OpenCFD's OpenFOAM versions](http://openfoam.com),
where the new positions are actually written to the file `coordinates`, while
the old ones are still written to `positions`.

$ wclean
```


How to use it
=============

For the function object, simply add the following block to your
`system/controlDict`, inside the block `functions`, e.g.:

```
functions
{
    writeCloudOldStyle1
    {
        type        writeCloudOldStyle;
        libs        ("liblagrangianExtraFunctionObjects.so");

        writeControl writeTime;

        clouds
        (
            kinematicCloud
        );
    }
}
```

Correct the name `kinematicCloud` to the actual name of the cloud you want to
track, which should be implied in the file name for the respective cloud, e.g.
`constant/kinematicCloudProperties` refers to `kinematicCloud`.

This function object will create the position files `positions.orig` inside each
time step cloud folder, e.g. in the folder `5e-05/lagrangian/kinematicCloud`.

Therefore, before you run `paraFoam -builtin`, you must run these commands:

```
find -name positions | while read line; do mv $line $line.coord; mv $line.orig $line; done
find -name positions | while read line; do sed -b -i -e 's=^\(.*object.*\)positions.orig;=\1positions;=' $line; done
```

They will rename all `positions` files to `positions.coord`, along with renaming
and correcting the files `positions.orig` to `positions`.

But keep in mind that before you can continue the simulation, you must run the
following command:

```
find -name positions | while read line; do mv $line $line.orig; mv $line.coord $line; done
```


Practical example
=================

Here is a practical example for the tutorial case `lagrangian/MPPICFoam/column`. The
following commands are used to create a copy of the tutorial case to the default `run`
folder:

```
run
cp -r $FOAM_TUTORIALS/lagrangian/MPPICFoam/column MPPICFoam_column
cd MPPICFoam_column
```

Next, it depends on your workflow:
* If you want the position files to be generated while the solver is running,
follow the steps on this section: [Example steps for doing things along with the solver](#example-steps-for-doing-things-along-with-the-solver)

* If you want the position files to be generated after the solver has already been run,
then follow the steps on this section:
[Example steps for doing things after the solver was already used and you don't want to run it again](#example-steps-for-doing-things-after-the-solver-was-already-used-and-you-dont-want-to-run-it-again)


Example steps for doing things along with the solver
----------------------------------------------------

1. Edit the file `system/controlDict` and add the block `writeCloudOldStyle1`
inside the block `functions`, as shown here:

    ```
    functions
    {
        writeCloudOldStyle1
        {
            type        writeCloudOldStyle;
            libs        ("liblagrangianExtraFunctionObjects.so");
    
            writeControl writeTime;
    
            clouds
            (
                kinematicCloud
            );
        }
    }
    ```

2. Save the file `system/controlDict`.

3. Now you can run the solver. For this specific tutorial case, you can run the
following command, which will run `blockMesh` and `MPPICFoam` for you:

    ```
    foamRunTutorials
    ```

4. Once the solver is finished running, run these commands:

   ```
   find -name positions | while read line; do mv $line $line.coord; mv $line.orig $line; done
   find -name positions | while read line; do sed -b -i -e 's=^\(.*object.*\)positions.orig;=\1positions;=' $line; done
   ```

5. Finally, you can use the following command to start ParaView to open the case
with the built-in reader:

   ```
   paraFoam -builtin
   ```


Example steps for doing things after the solver was already used and you don't want to run it again
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new file `system/positionConvertDict` and add the following content,
as shown here:

    ```
    /*--------------------------------*- C++ -*----------------------------------*\
    | =========                 |                                                 |

    FoamFile
    {
        version     2.0;
        format      ascii;
        class       dictionary;
        location    "system";
        object      positionConvertDict;
    }
    // * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * //

    functions
    {
        writeCloudOldStyle1
        {
            type        writeCloudOldStyle;
            libs        ("liblagrangianExtraFunctionObjects.so");
    
            writeControl writeTime;
    
            clouds
            (
                kinematicCloud
            );
        }
    }
    ```

2. Save the file `system/positionConvertDict`.

3. Now, assuming you already ran the solver for this tutorial, then you can run
the solver again in post-processing mode, like this:

    ```
    MPPICFoam -postProcess -dict system/positionConvertDict
    ```

4. Once the solver is finished running, run these commands:

   ```
   find -name positions | while read line; do mv $line $line.coord; mv $line.orig $line; done
   find -name positions | while read line; do sed -b -i -e 's=^\(.*object.*\)positions.orig;=\1positions;=' $line; done
   ```

5. Finally, you can use the following command to start ParaView to open the case
with the built-in reader:

   ```
   paraFoam -builtin
   ```

**Warning**: If you get an error message such as this:

```
--> FOAM FATAL ERROR: 

    request for kinematicCloud coalCloud1 from objectRegistry region0 failed
    available objects of type kinematicCloud are
0()
```

This means that the solver does not load the clouds for post-processing. You
will either have to use swak4Foam to load the cloud, or use a custom function
object to do it for you. Alternatively, you can report this issue to the bug
tracker of the respective OpenFOAM version/variant you are using.
